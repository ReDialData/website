# Conversational Recommendation: Movie Dialogues Dataset

This page contains the description and download links to the movie dialogues dataset presented in the NIPS 2018 paper "Towards Deep Conversational Recommendations" by Raymond Li, Samira Kahou, Hannes Schulz, Vincent Michalski, Laurent Charlin, and Chris Pal.

## Motivation for Creating the Dataset

### Why was the Dataset Created?

The dataset allows research at the intersection of goal-directed dialogue systems (such as restaurant recommendation) and free-form (also called "chit-chat") dialogue systems.

### Which other tasks can it be used for?

In the dataset, users talk about which movies they like and which ones they do not like, which ones they have seen or not etc., and labels which we ensured agree between the two participants.
This allows to research how sentiment is expressed in dialogues, which differs a lot from e.g. review websites.

The dialogues and the movies they mention form a curious bi-partite graph structure, which is related to how users talk about the movie (e.g. genre information).

Ignoring label information, this dataset can also be viewed as a limited domain chit-chat dialogue dataset.

### Who Funded the Creation of the Dataset?
